A Novel NeRF-based Approach for Extracting Single Objects and Generating Synthetic Training Data for Grasp Prediction Models 
(docs/Thesis_project_README)

## Main Objectives

  1. Object Extraction via NeRFs: Utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to extract individual objects effectively.
  2. Composition of Realistic Scenes: Combine multiple NeRFs representing various objects and backgrounds to create diverse and lifelike scenes.
  3. Synthetic Dataset Generation: Generate a synthetic dataset leveraging NeRF technology for training purposes.
  4. Training Grasp Prediction Networks: Train a grasp prediction network using the generated synthetic dataset.
  5. Training on Real Data: Train another grasp prediction network using real-world datasets for comparative analysis.
  6. Performance Evaluation: Evaluate and compare the performance of both networks using real-world datasets to assess their effectiveness.
